Muscle fatigue represents a multifaceted phenomenon with physical and chemical changes in muscle as well as alterations in nervous system efficiency, which are related to different causes, mechanisms and symptoms (Cifrek et al., 2009). The monitoring of local muscle fatigue can be conducted by measuring myoelectric activity via EMG which may represent biochemical and physiological changes during exercise (De Luca, 1984). Traditionally, EMG is used in detecting fatigue through incremental or constant exercise protocols, during which slow twitch and fast twitch fibers are progressively recruited as exercise proceeds (Guffey et al., 2012; Malek et al., 2006; Travis et al., 2011). During maximal all-out exercise, characterized by the attainment of peak power at the start of the 3MT, the majority of available motor units should be recruited along with an alteration of firing rate and a reversal of the progressive muscle activation pattern utilized during incremental or constant exercise may occur (Sargeant et al., 1981; McCartney et al., 1983). Subsequently, fast twitch fibers would be expected to generate a greater proportion of the total external power output (Beelen and Sargeant 1993). Thereafter, these fibers would become progressively fatigued at a rapid rate, potentially leading to a greater reliance on slow twitch fibers, resulting in decreased power output due to the high fatigue resistance but low contraction speed characteristics of slow twitch fibers (McCartney et al., 1983; Sargeant et al., 1981). Due to this unique muscle recruitment pattern and alteration of firing rate, changes in the EMG signal during the 3MT should be evident. However, the changes in muscle fiber conduction velocity, assessed via surface EMG frequency, associated with this testing protocol have yet to be evaluated.

Mean frequency (MNF) and median frequency (MDF) are two useful frequency-domain parameters of EMG analysis which are frequently used to detect fatigue in the target muscles (De Luca, 1984). According to the definition, both MNF and MDF can represent the shift of the frequency spectrum of the EMG signal. Thus, the general behavior of MNF and MDF should be analogous, however, there are conflicting results regarding which frequency parameter is more suitable for evaluation of fatigue and the results may vary among different muscles or exercise protocols (Stulen and De Luca, 1981). Additionally, some studies have reported differences in variance between MNF and MDF, the MNF had a lower standard deviation (Balestra et al., 1988; Knaflitz et al., 1990). EMG frequency, specifically MNF, has been used to detect fatigue thresholds during graded exercise testing (Camic et al., 2010). To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever compared MNF and MDF in corresponding to the changes in neuromuscular function during the 3MT.
